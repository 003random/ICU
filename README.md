## ðŸ“Œ Description 

# Install 
```bash ./install.sh ``` The installation script asks for various things, including your MySQL database username and password. These will be saved in credentials.py. You can always change these credentials later on. 

## Optional (recommended)
ICU also uses [Subfinder]("https://github.com/Ice3man543/subfinder") and [Amass]("https://github.com/caffix/amass/"). 
You need to install those as well. You need to have GO for those tools. [Here]("https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-debian-8") you can find how to install GO. 
After you've installed GO; Execute the following commands to install Amass and Subfinder: 
```
go get github.com/caffix/amass
go get github.com/Ice3man543/subfinder
```


# Telegram 
ICU also includes a telegram bot and notifications part. If you want to use this, you will have to include your telegram bot token in credentials.py. You can get a telegram bot token [here]("https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot"). Next off, you need to run setup.py in /telegram, and then send /start to the bot. This will save your chat_id to credentials.py so it can be used for authentication with the bot, and to send the notifications to.  
 
# Modules 
The following modules are used: MySQLdb, telegram, random, sys, os, datetime, logging, time. 
 
The install script offers an option to install the modules from requirements.txt. This requires pip to be installed. If, for some reason, some modules are still missing. Then install these modules. The most important one is MySQLdb. [here]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25865270/how-to-install-python-mysqldb-module-using-pip") you can read how to install MySQLdb.  

# Extra
